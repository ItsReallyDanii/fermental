# Questions for Reviewers

1. Are the comparator baselines fair and representative of standard practice?
2. Do split policies adequately prevent temporal/session/source leakage?
3. Are robustness tests realistic for anticipated domain shifts?
4. Is calibration evaluated at operationally meaningful thresholds?
5. Are improvements practically significant or only statistically significant?
6. Which claims are defensible now vs speculative pending new evidence?
7. What failure mode would most likely invalidate the current conclusion?
8. Is compute complexity realistic for intended Phase 1 reproducibility constraints?
