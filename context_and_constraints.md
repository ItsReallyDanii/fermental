# Context and Constraints

## Project Scope
Phase 1 is a software artifact focused on evidence and reproducibility.

## In Scope
- Public/research datasets
- Time-series feature engineering for bioelectrical/redox and conventional signals
- Baseline and ablation modeling
- Robustness + calibration analysis
- Claims audit with citations

## Out of Scope
- New wet-lab experiments
- Hardware/electrode design
- Field deployment claims
- Commercial performance claims

## Resource Constraints
- Compute: single workstation (CPU/GPU optional) or low-cost cloud
- Time: short-cycle decision support for go/no-go on Phase 2
- Budget: minimal external spend

## Reproducibility Requirements
- Fixed random seeds
- Documented split strategy
- Leakage controls
- Versioned configs and schema-validated outputs
